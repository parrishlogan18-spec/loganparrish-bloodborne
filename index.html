<br><b>Gameplay and What's at Stake</b><br>

  <br>Bloodborne is a third person action RPG like other FromSoftware’s game such as Dark Souls, Elden Ring, and Sekiro Shadows Die Twice. You play as a character that you can create, that is an outsider to Yharnam the country the game is set it, the first thing you is sign a contract and become something called a hunter. Instead of hiding Bloodborne pushes its player to dodge and counterattack not giving the player a lot of stealth options. Bloodborne uses a Health and Stamina system for its players character and with its level up system you can improve many of your stats. An additional system that is connected to health is the rally system which allows you to regain lost health by attacking and landing hits right after you are damaged. To level up you must kill enemies to collect blood echoes, there are many ways to accomplish this through Trick Weapons, Firearms, or Arcane.  Trick Weapons are the main source of damage at a hunter’s disposal they are able change forms mid fight to create more complex combos. There are many types of Trick Weapons available to find in Yharnam though the options provided at the start are an axe, a cane, and a saw. Firearms are another important part of gameplay they are used to stagger an enemy to allow you to go in for a critical attack or hit them a few times. Arcane the final type of damage is Bloodborne’s version of magic, you call upon outer gods to use their abilities such as summoning tentacles to attack a foe. The most important part of gameplay is to always learn from your last death as it will be a common occurrence and to learn how to dodge properly. <br>

  <br>As for what’s at stake, A blood plague has taken over the city and has changed its inhabitants into beasts. After signing your hunter contract, you join the night to hunt the beasts that have taken over the city and to search for a cure or at least to escape. As you progress through the game the stakes drastically increase depending on how much you care to the people in this country foreign to you. You discover the blood affecting the population is from great ones who are essentially gods and that is why it makes people turn into beasts, to end the night you must kill the great one influencing the eternal night that has fallen upon Yharnam.<br>
  <br>Below is the opening to Bloodborne where we as the player sign our contract and join the night hunt, I think that it really helps set the scene of where exactly you are now<br>

  <br><b>Narrative</b><br>

  <br>The game begins with you as an outsider traveling to the city of Yharnam in search for its “healing blood” provided by the church, the only way to receive it as an outsider is to sign a contract and become a hunter. After waking up from your transfusion you are immediately thrown into a very violet world where everything you see that is moving is out to get you. On the event of your first death you don’t respawn where you died you wake up in the Hunters Dream, a safe place for Hunters to rest, buy supplies, and level up. You are able to traverse all of Yharnam through the Hunters Dreams headstones that act as portals. In the Dream you are introduced to wheelchair bound Gehrman the first hunter who watches over the dream and ensures the night continues. You also meet the Doll who is who you must interact with to level up throughout the game. After leaving the dream you wander Lower Yharnam killing blood drunk townspeople that have turned into beasts. Until you find Father Gascoigne, a large paster who has been driven mad by blood, you must defeat him to be able to access Oeden Chapel and enter Cathedral Ward. After gaining access to Oeden Chapel your next goal is to defect Vicar Amelia a women turned into a huge beast to collect a gold pendant from her that will give you access to the next area and descend deeper into the night. After that you can do a couple of things such as explore the deeper areas of Yharnam like Yahar’gul the Unseen Village. However, the next required step to further the game is to Kill Rom the Vacuous Spider which will cause the Bloodmoon the rise and send all the enemies in Yharnam into a frenzy. The final step to end the nightmare that overtook Yharnam is to kill Mergo’s Wetnurse which is protecting an infant great one. Once that is completed you will go back to the Hunter’s Dream and the Doll will tell you that Gehrman is waiting for you and you will be given a choice at the end.<br>
<br>To simplify it the church collected contaminated blood and discovered its healing properties without realizing its side effects and it affects the entire population that has used it. This blood is from a great one, which are higher plane beings that just seeing can send a normal person insane. However, this did not stop the church from fighting over it so they split into different factions based on different beliefs. The blood drove a wedge throughout all of Yharnam and sent its people into a downfall. <br>
  
  <br> Take a moment to listen to this song that is featured in the game, I found that it really captures the creepy yet entrancing feelings felt through out the game. <br>

  <br><b>The Ending</b><br>

  <br>There are three different endings available to the player at the end of the game with the true ending being more difficult to get.<br>
<br><b>Submission Ending:</b> You accept the cycle but want to escape it, you submit yourself to Gehrman and he beheads you releasing you from the dream and you wake up and the sun is rising however the nightmare still persist for your fellow hunters.<br>
  <br><b>Hunter’s Legacy Ending:</b> You refuse to submit to Gehrman, and you enter a fight to the death with him, upon his defeat the Moon Presence, the outer god responsible for creating the Hunter’s Dream descends and makes you take his place to guide future hunters.<br>
  <br><b>Ascension True Ending:</b>This ending is different from the others because it requires you to have consumed 3 of a specific item called “One Third of Umbilical Cord” which are connected to great ones. One is given to you for killing Mergo’s Wetnurse, the other two must be found through searching or creation. Before going to speak to Gehrman at the end of the game you must have consumed 3 of them to unlock the true ending. It follows the same story as the Hunter’s Legacy Ending, however, changes when the Moon Presence descends, because you consumed the Umbilical Cord of a great one it can’t control you, so you enter a fight with it. Upon defeating the Moon Presence, you ascend and transform into an infant great one to grow into your own thing.<br>
