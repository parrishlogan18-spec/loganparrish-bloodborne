<br><b>Gameplay and What's at Stake</b><br>

  <br>Bloodborne is a third person action RPG like other FromSoftware’s game such as Dark Souls, Elden Ring, and Sekiro Shadows Die Twice. You play as a character that you can create, that is an outsider to Yharnam the country the game is set it, the first thing you is sign a contract and become something called a hunter. Instead of hiding Bloodborne pushes its player to dodge and counterattack not giving the player a lot of stealth options. Bloodborne uses a Health and Stamina system for its players character and with its level up system you can improve many of your stats. An additional system that is connected to health is the rally system which allows you to regain lost health by attacking and landing hits right after you are damaged. To level up you must kill enemies to collect blood echoes, there are many ways to accomplish this through Trick Weapons, Firearms, or Arcane.  Trick Weapons are the main source of damage at a hunter’s disposal they are able change forms mid fight to create more complex combos. There are many types of Trick Weapons available to find in Yharnam though the options provided at the start are an axe, a cane, and a saw. Firearms are another important part of gameplay they are used to stagger an enemy to allow you to go in for a critical attack or hit them a few times. Arcane the final type of damage is Bloodborne’s version of magic, you call upon outer gods to use their abilities such as summoning tentacles to attack a foe. The most important part of gameplay is to always learn from your last death as it will be a common occurrence and to learn how to dodge properly. 
As for what’s at stake, A blood plague has taken over the city and has changed its inhabitants into beasts. After signing your hunter contract, you join the night to hunt the beasts that have taken over the city and to search for a cure or at least to escape. As you progress through the game the stakes drastically increase depending on how much you care to the people in this country foreign to you. You discover the blood affecting the population is from great ones who are essentially gods and that is why it makes people turn into beasts, to end the night you must kill the great one influencing the eternal night that has fallen upon Yharnam.
